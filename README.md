## For visualising data on properties currently available for short-term rental through AirBnb in Tasmania. 

Hobart is currently experiencing a housing crisis that is massively exacerbated by the conversion of long-term rental properties into short-stay accommodation. 

## Data

Data are open source, provided by the fantastic [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com). If you appreciate their work, [**DONATE HERE!**](http://insideairbnb.com/donate)

These scripts use the detailed listings data, listings.csv, for the last twelve months in Tasmania (not the summary data). Download the data [here.](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data)

## Output

The script will save a simple overview map with all locations plotted, and an html file with an interactive map. Markers are sized and coloured according to the price per bedroom (hover over the marker to see the price)
